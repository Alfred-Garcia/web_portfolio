            <p>
              I currently work as a Student Affairs Professional
              at a University in southern California. While I truly
              love my job, I have been in this field for over 8
              years and have recently found my mind drifting to
              other avenues of learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              One field of study in particular facinated me but seemed
              completely inaccessible, web development! I didn't grow
              up with a computer in my home and didn't have access to
              the internet until I was nearly 15. So you can imagine
              how complex the web seemed to me at that stage in my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well...fast foward about 15 years and the web has gotten
              more complex than ever! The great thing about it is...I too
              have grown...into an amazing Web Developer!

                This project was my first project as a Web Developer. I got to
                work with various members of this workplace to truly make an
                intuitive UI/UX for their department. Additionally, this project
                was designed as a Desktop first approach with mobile responsiveness.
